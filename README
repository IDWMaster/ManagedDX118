Compiling
=====================================
To compile and run, use the included DirectXApplication.sln
To compile for Release mode, just leave the default references. However, if you change to debug mode, the references to DXInteropLib have to be re-mapped for the new configuration, and (for some reason; this must be a VS11 glitch), you have to rebuild the entire solution.
